Fruit
The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn.[1] 
The true fruits or carpels are the harder interior chambers inside the apple's core. 
There are usually five carpels inside an apple, but there may be as few as three. 
Each of the chambers contains one or two seeds.[9] The edible flesh is formed from the receptacle at the base of the flower.[10]

The seeds are egg- to pear-shaped and may be colored from light brown or tan to a very dark brown, often with red shades or even purplish-black. They may have a blunt or sharp point.[11] The five sepals remain attached and stand out from the surface of the apple.[1]

The size of the fruit varies widely between cultivars, but generally has a diameter between 2.5 and 12 cm (1 and 5 in).[7] The shape is quite variable and may be nearly round, elongated, conical, or short and wide.[12]

The groundcolor of ripe apples is yellow, green, yellow-green or whitish yellow. 
The overcolor of ripe apples can be orange-red, pink-red, red, purple-red or brown-red. 
The overcolor amount can be 0â€“100%.[13] The skin may be wholly or partly russeted, making it rough and brown. 
The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax.[14] The skin may also be marked with scattered dots.[1] 
The flesh is generally pale yellowish-white, though it can be pink, yellow or green.[13]
